    <h1>About ROM Hacking</h1>

    <p>ROM hacking is the process of editing a video game’s data to create something new. People often change character sprites, levels, music, or even rewrite the game’s dialogue. It’s a creative way to learn how games work and to design custom experiences using older titles.</p>

    <p>To hack a ROM, you usually need tools that can edit maps, graphics, or code. Many online communities share guides, tutorials, and resources that teach beginners how to modify games safely. ROM hacking is popular among fans who enjoy building mods, translations, or entirely new versions of their favorite classics.</p>
